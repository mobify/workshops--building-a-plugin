# Step 6 - Styling

It would be great if our credit card input gave us some visual indication of a card being identified. Let's make that happen. 

## Task:

1. First, let's add some basic styling for `seesee`'s input. 

  Open `src/style/seesee.scss` and add the following to the `.seesee` selector.
  
  ```scss
    .seesee {
        
    }
  ```

1. Next, we want to add specific styles for the input once the card has been identified. Add the following below the above CSS.

    ```scss
    ```

## All done!

If you want to view the finished product, just use `grunt examples`. It will open up your browser and point you to the examples page of your plugin.
