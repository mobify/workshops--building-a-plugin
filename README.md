# Step 7 - Finished!

You've successfully created a new plugin using the plugin factory. We learned how the `_init` method works, how to bind events, how to respond to events, and how to style our plugin. We've also tested it along the way, so we can help ensure no regressions happen.

If you want to view the finished product, just use `grunt examples`. It will open up your browser and point you to the examples page of your plugin.
