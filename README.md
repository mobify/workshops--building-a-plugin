# Step 1 - Generate the plugin scaffold

Since you've already installed the `generator-plugin` yeoman generator (and I know you have!), we can generate our plugin scaffold very easily. The scaffold comes with a structure like this:

## Task:

1. Start the plugin generator using the following command in your terminal:

 ```cli
 yo plugin
 ```

1. We're going to call our plugin **seesee**. Enter that now.
1. When prompted for a description, enter **this**.
2. When prompted about whether or not to use Velocity, choose **no (n)**.
3. When prompted as to whether our plugin requires a theme file, choose **no (n)**.

Once you enter the above, your plugin will be generated by yeoman. 

## Ready to Continue?

Once you're ready to continue, run the following command in your terminal:

```cli
git clean -f && git checkout step-2-
```

Then, follow the directions in that branch's README
